Introduced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Phasma is the commander of the First Order's force of stormtroopers. Christie confirmed that the character would reappear in the next of the trilogy's films, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The character also made an additional appearance in Before the Awakening, an anthology book set before the events of The Force Awakens.","J. J. Abrams created Phasma from an armor design originally developed for Kylo Ren and named her after the 1979 horror film Phantasm. The character was originally conceived as male before being changed to female. Phasma appeared prominently in promotion and marketing for The Force Awakens, but the character's ultimately minor role in the film was the subject of criticism. Nonetheless, merchandise featuring the character found success and her figure was the bestselling of all Force Awakens action figures on Amazon.co.uk.[3]"],"idSwapi":88}}
