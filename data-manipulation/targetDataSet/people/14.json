      "Han Solo is a character in the Star Wars franchise. In the original film trilogy, Han and his co-pilot, Chewbacca, became involved in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire. During the course of the Star Wars narrative, he becomes a chief figure in the Alliance and succeeding galactic governments. Star Wars creator George Lucas described the character as \"a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good\".[2] Harrison Ford portrayed the character in the original Star Wars trilogy as well as The Force Awakens. Alden Ehrenreich will portray a young Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story."
